    <p>
      When the Carolina Colony was founded in 1680, rivers were its principal means of transportation. Gradually, old American Indian trading paths became a network of roads. By 1735 the colonial road known as the King's Highway joined Charleston to Boston. In this early period, ferries were an important part of the transportation network. The first ferry across the Combahee River began operation in 1715. The ferry, a tavern, and later a store, operated until 1927 when the first permanent bridge over the river was constructed. The bridge was replaced in 1947 and again in 2008 when the four-lane Harriet Tubman Memorial Bridge opened.

      <h2>Charleston to Port Royal Road</h2>
      <p>The Charleston to Port Royal Road extended travel south to Port Royal, Beaufort, and Savannah.
Construction began in 1711. The King’s Highway and the Charleston to Port Royal Road were the primary routes for traffic in coastal South Carolina. They connected the rice producing regions on the Combahee River to agents in Charleston who sold the rice to countries in Europe. Today the old Charleston to Port Royal road right-of-way is a dirt road that runs through the CFHD until it rejoins U.S. Highway 17 approximately 1,200 feet south of the district.

      <h2>Combahee Ferry</h2>
      <p>Ferries were an important part of the Lowcountry transportation network because of the region’s many marshes and rivers. In 1686 the Lords Proprietors ordered anyone granted land with a river to operate a ferry. Combahee Ferry was established by 1715. The ferry and causeway were located half a mile upriver from where U.S. Highway 17 crosses the river today. A 1733 re-charter of Combahee Ferry moved the crossing to its present location.  Joseph Bryan was the first known ferry keeper.  As roads expanded and the popularity of the automobile increased, ferries became inconvenient. Combahee Ferry ceased to operate in 1927, when the first permanent bridge over the river was constructed.</p>

      <h2>Charleston to Savannah RR</h2>
      <p>Construction of the first railroad in South Carolina in 1833 changed the transportation landscape. The 136-mile-long Charleston and Hamburg Rail Road (C&HRR) made it easier to transport goods from the Upstate to the port at Charleston. The Charleston & Savannah Railroad (C&SRR) was chartered in 1854 to extend shipping routes farther south by connecting Charleston and Savannah. During the Civil War, the railroad was an important Confederate supply route. Robert E. Lee ordered the construction of batteries at the Combahee Ferry crossing to keep the C&SRR open and ensure troops and equipment could move in and out of the region.
