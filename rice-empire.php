    <p>The marshes along the Combahee River were the setting of a vast rice empire from 1740 until 1863. Even today it is not hard to imagine these marshes as thousands of acres of golden rice. This landscape is one of the features that makes CFHD a significant place in South Carolina. The Combahee River rice plantations were owned by some of the richest men in South Carolina. Their affluent lifestyle is hard to image. Commercial rice production in South Carolina ended in 1920 and moved west to Louisiana and Texas.</p>

      <h2>Combahee River Rice Plantations</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Henry Middleton (pictured below), William Heyward, Stephen Bull and others made great fortunes growing rice along the Combahee River with the labor of thousands of enslaved Africans. Henry Middleton’s Newport and Hobonny plantations extended from just below U.S. 17 as far upriver as the eye can see. William Heyward’s Cypress Plantation was located across the river. In 1850, 300 slaves at Cypress Plantation produced 1,350,000 pounds of rice. The marshes visible from the U.S. Highway 17 causeway were Cypress rice fields.  In 1863, the Union Army struck at the heart of South Carolina’s plantation economy by burning Combahee River rice plantations. </p>

        <h2>Rice and Slavery</h2>
      </header>
      <p>From the founding of Carolina, enslaved Africans were imported into the colony as agricultural workers. As rice production expanded, the number of African captives brought to the colony increased dramatically. Rice was grown in parts of Africa for hundreds of years before it became a Carolina commodity.  Planters preferred people from Africa’s rice growing countries. Captives from these areas knew how to build fields, control water, and plant and process the rice.</p>

        <ul class="fyi">
          <li>Approximately 500,000 Africans were brought to North America before the direct importation of captives was banned in 1808.</li>

          <li>In 1860, four million people were enslaved in the United States.</li>

      <h2>Building Rice Fields</h2>
      <p>Early on, enslaved people built fields and grew rice in swamps along creeks and small branches away from the main channel of the Combahee River. In the late eighteenth century, planters decided to move their fields closer to the river and use the tide to flood their fields. It is estimated that enslaved people moved more than six million cubic feet of earth in the Combahee River region to construct a complex network of rice fields, canals, dikes, and banks. Today the former rice fields are covered in large stands of marsh grasses. The former fields are defined by large and small ditches or channels that flow into the Combahee River through the primary canals that parallel the U.S. Highway 17 causeway.</p>
