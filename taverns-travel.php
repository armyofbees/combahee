    <p>Travel in the 18th and early 19th century was slow and difficult.  It could take days to travel a distance we might travel in only a few hours. Taverns and public houses were an important part of the early transportation network because they provided food, drink, stabling and care for horses, and a place to sleep for weary travelers. In South Carolina, taverns were often associated with ferry crossings, particularly on larger waterways. In 1735 Colonel John Mullryne of Beaufort built a combination store, lodging house, and public house at Combahee Ferry. A store operated at the Combahee River crossing until 1927.</p>

      <h2>Before Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</h2>
      <p>Before the invention of trains and cars, travel in South Carolina could be slow, arduous, and even dangerous. Roads were often rutted and rudimentary, and crossing the region's many rivers and streams was difficult. Poor folks and enslaved people walked from place to place. People with a little extra money could purchase a horse. Wealthy merchants and planters had carriages or coaches to carry them to their destination. In the Lowcountry, small boats that could navigate the region’s inland waterways were essential for moving people and goods.</p>

      <h2>The Role of Taverns</h2>
      <p>Taverns were rest stops for tired and hungry travelers, as well as important secular gathering places for meetings, entertainment, and conversation. The tavern keeper could be counted on for the latest news of the day. Public houses operated at all levels of society. Rural taverns usually catered to lower and middle class patrons, although travelers from all levels of society were welcome. Generally, tavern archaeological sites contain lots of artifacts associated with drinking and smoking. This was not the case with the tavern found in the CFHD. Perhaps this tavern was more of a stopover for travelers and not a gathering place for locals.</p>

      <h2>Haymarket Tavern</h2>
    </header>
    <p>In 1735, Colonel John Mullryne of Beaufort constructed a store, lodging, and public house at Combahee Ferry.  By 1766, the tavern was known as Haymarket.  Mary “Polly” Keating owned and operated Haymarket tavern and store independent from her husband. Researchers do not know who operated the tavern during the 19th century, but a tavern or store served travelers at Combahee Ferry until 1927 when the first permanent bridge over the river was constructed. Archaeologists found garbage pits and a large privy or outhouse they believe served the tavern and ferry keeper’s house. Their excavations recovered pottery, bottle glass, buttons, animal bones, smoking pipes, lamp parts, nails, and window glass, and give us a glimpse into the household goods used by the ferry keeper or travelers during the early 19th century.</p>
